Courses from my education at SoftUni

## [Programming Basics](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/SoftUni-Courses/tree/main/Programming_Basics)
The course “Programming Basics” provides initial programming skills necessary for all technological specialties at SoftUni. This includes writing program code at a basic level (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).
### Acquired skills:
* Working with the console (data input and output)
* Working with loops (for)
* Working with more complex logical checks
* Working with logical checks (if-else)
* Performing simple calculations
* Working with more complex loops (nested for loops and while)

## [Programming Fundamentals](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/SoftUni-Courses/tree/main/fundamentals)
With the “Programming Fundamentals” course, students will begin to study SoftUni’s internal program for comprehensive preparation of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in professional modules. The trainees build on the knowledge acquired in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex techniques and structures from programming such as: lists, dictionaries, objects, and classes.

Additional technologies necessary for every software developer, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations, and others, will be studied. The basics of web development will be examined, as well as some of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds an idea in the students about the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will acquire from them to become successful software developers.
### Acquired skills: 
* Handling the standard functionality of the programming language
* Problem analysis and reduction to computer-executable steps
* Working with linear data structures
* Basic skills for working with HTML and CSS
* Understanding the interconnection between different IT concepts
